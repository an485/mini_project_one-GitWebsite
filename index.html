  			<h1>About Me</h1>
  			<p>My name is Anthony Nater and I am a New Jersey native currently enrolled in the graduate certificate program for Business and Information Systems Implementation.   Upon fully completing the certificate program I plan to matriculate my credits earned into the MS in Business and Information Systems degree here at NJIT.</p>

 <p>After earning a B.A. in Communications in 2004, my professional career began in a small management company which spanned 7 years. Here my role encompassed everything from website development, digital marketing, to graphic design for each of our clients. For the past 5 years I have been working for a lead management and marketing automation software company called Sparkroom where I have been focusing on a career in product management. As a Product Manager, I have continued to develop my skills in Agile development processes and have managed the full product lifecycle for multiple web properties, integrated web services, analytics services, and more. This involves (at various capacities) ongoing business assessment, system analysis, requirements gathering/authoring, prototyping, UI design, and user research.	
  			</p>
  			<p> Earning my BISI Certificate and MSBIS here at NJIT I hope to gain the extensive knowledge and foundational education required to help drive a successful career into a more senior level product manager role within a software or web technology based company. </p>
